# The Supermarket

You can compile the project with sbt:

```sh
scala-effects> sbt
sbt> project supermarket
sbt> compile
```

Our aim is to code up a stream that will represent shoppers paying at two checkouts, one of which is for fast shoppers only. You can see the illustration in `supermarket/supermarket.png` for a rough idea of the input and output streams.

Good luck!
